# Spring Security Project üöÄ

Welcome to the **Spring Security Project**! This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Spring Security** for securing Java-based applications. It shows how to configure authentication, authorization, and other security measures to protect web applications from unauthorized access.

## Introduction üéØ
Spring Security is a powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications. This project serves as a guide to help developers integrate **Spring Security** into their applications with a focus on security best practices, such as:
- Authentication (basic and JWT token-based)
- Authorization (role-based access control)
- CSRF protection
- Session management
- Secure password hashing

The goal of this project is to provide developers with a **working example** of how to integrate Spring Security with their own applications and enable strong security measures.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Authentication**: Secure login and token-based authentication (JWT).
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with custom permission rules.
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) prevention.
- **Password Encoding**: Secure password storage with BCrypt.
- **Custom Security Configurations**: Flexibility to configure your own authentication mechanisms.
- **Session Management**: Secure handling of user sessions and logout functionality.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine and follow the steps to set up the Spring Security configuration.

### Prerequisites üîß
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- A database (optional, depending on your setup)
  
### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Devang-sharma609/Spring_Security.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Spring_Security
    ```

3. Build the project using Maven or Gradle:
    - Maven:
      ```bash
      mvn clean install
      ```
    - Gradle:
      ```bash
      gradle build
      ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    gradle bootRun
    ```

Now, your application should be up and running locally!

## Usage ‚ö°
After setting up the project, you can test authentication and authorization functionality using the following API endpoints:

- **POST** `/login`: Log in with user credentials (returns JWT token).
- **GET** `/user`: Get user info (accessible only if authenticated).
- **GET** `/admin`: Admin page (accessible only for users with `ROLE_ADMIN`).

You can customize these endpoints or add more depending on your application‚Äôs needs.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

This repository provides a flexible configuration file (`application.properties` or `application.yml`) for managing different Spring Security properties. You can configure:

- JWT token secret and expiration time.
- Roles and access rules.
- Login and logout behavior.
- Session settings and CSRF configurations.

### Example `application.properties`:

```properties
# JWT Configuration
jwt.secret=your_jwt_secret_key
jwt.expiration=3600000

# Spring Security Settings
spring.security.user.name=user
spring.security.user.password=secretpassword
spring.security.roles=USER,ADMIN
```

Make sure to modify the configuration according to your environment.
